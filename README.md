# The Halo Code

## Mission Statement

The Halo Code is designed to clearly codify a set of shared values and expectations in order to provide a safe, productive and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, political beliefs, disability, personal appearance, body size, nationality, ethnicity, or other similar characteristic.

The Halo Code is authored with Blackstone's Formulation in mind. To this end, we have erred on the side of explicit definitions and limited scope, so that contributors do not have to fear accidental violation of the Code, and to reduce the potential for expansive interpretations of the Code.
