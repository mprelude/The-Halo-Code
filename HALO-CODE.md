# [Project Name] Code of Conduct

## 1 About The Code of Conduct

### 1.1 Definitions

These definitions are used throughout the document:

* THE PROJECT means [Project Name];
* PROJECT MODERATORS means those responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct (see 3.3 'Moderator Contacts').
* PROJECT SPACES means the physical and digital channels of communication for the PROJECT (see 1.3 'Applicable Spaces').
* THE CODE and THE CODE OF CONDUCT refer to this document.
* PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS refers to age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, physical or psychological disability, personal appearance, body size, body shape, nationality, ethnicity, religious beliefs or political beliefs.
* PRIVATE INFORMATION about a person means any information which they have not disclosed publicly.
* The REPORTING PARTY, when in the context of a transgression report, refers to the person making the report.
* The ACCUSED PARTY, when in the context of a transgression report, refers to a person accused in the report of transgressing against THE CODE.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

The first goal of THE CODE is to specify a baseline standard of acceptable behaviour, so that people with different social values and communication styles can collaborate on THE PROJECT effectively, productively and respectfully.

The second goal of THE CODE is to communicate in a clear and concise manner, in order to enable contributors to collaborate without fear of variable interpretations of vague definitions. A healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate, and the purpose of THE CODE is not to create a mechanism to silence people.

The third goal of THE CODE is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts as they arise.

The fourth goal of THE CODE is to foster an inclusive community, and to enable contributors and users of all backgrounds to feel welcome and wanted.

### 1.3 Applicable Spaces

If you contribute to THE PROJECT in any way, you are encouraged to follow THE CODE OF CONDUCT whilst doing so.

However, explicit enforcement of THE CODE OF CONDUCT is limited to PROJECT SPACES as listed below:

* [Replace this list, these are examples]
* THE PROJECT [GitHub projects](https://github.com/mprelude/The-Halo-Code).
* THE PROJECT IRC channels: #halocode and #halocode-offtopic on FreeNode.
* Whenever a user is communicating with an @halocode.com e-mail address.

Other groups (such as conferences, meetups and unofficial communication channels) are encouraged to adopt THE CODE OF CONDUCT. Those groups must provide their own PROJECT MODERATORS.

## 2 Values

### 2.1 Exemplary Behaviour

These are the values to which participants in THE PROJECT should aspire:

#### 2.1.1 Patience

* Consider that not everyone is using their native language.
* Remember that people have different communication styles.
* Understand that people have varying levels of technical ability - try to help them, not make them feel stupid.

#### 2.1.2 Thought

* Think about how your words will be interpreted. Take your time and create thoughtful & creative replies.
* If you feel angry, confused or offended, take a break. None of us are good communicators whilst in this state.
* Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.

#### 2.1.3 Respect

* Respect differences in opinion and approach.
* Try to communicate in an amiable tone, refraining from making unproductive or sniping comments.

#### 2.1.4 Charitability

* Interpret the arguments of others in good faith. Do not assume they intend to offend or frustrate you.
* Try to understand points of view with which you disagree.

#### 2.1.5 Focus

* Stay on topic.
* Avoid discussing sensitive or potentially offensive subjects.

#### 2.1.6 Constructiveness

* Offer solutions instead of simply stating disagreements or problems.

### 2.2 Prohibited Behaviour

These actions are explicitly prohibited in PROJECT SPACES (*comments in italics are non-exhaustive examples, and are not a part of the rules*):

#### 2.2.1 Doxxing

* Publishing PRIVATE INFORMATION about another person without their explicit permission.
* *Examples include outing another person as transgender, posting another person's telephone number or revealing the contents of a person's private Twitter account.*

#### 2.2.2 Threats

* Declaring your intention to cause harm or loss to another person and/or their property.

#### 2.2.3 Insulting & Abusive Behavior

* Making a statement of an injurious untrue fact pertaining to another person or a true fact with deceptive intent that harms the reputation of that person.
* Making a statement with intent to cause an affront or indignity to a person's self-respect.
* Making a derogatory comment about another person's PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS.
* Harassing another person by repeatedly attempting to communicate with them, when they are not responding to your communications.
* *Calling a person an "idiot" is an insult, encouraging them to "run the tests before submitting a pull request" is not.*
* *Stating a person's PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS, by itself, is not an insult.*

#### 2.2.4 Discrimination

* Making generalized statements about people with specific PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS.
* *For example, statements like "all women belong in the kitchen" or "creationists are idiots".*

#### 2.2.5 Sexualization

* Using sexualized language or posting sexualized imagery.

#### 2.2.6 Incitement

* Inciting others to perform any of the activities specified in sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 or 2.2.5 against a person.
* Posting suspected transgressions of THE CODE in a public space, instead of handling it through the correct channels (see section 3).

### 2.3 Topics of Discussion

PROJECT SPACES are for discussion of THE PROJECT, and are not free speech venues. They are subejct to moderation, the goal of which is to facilitate civil and on-topic discussion.

In particular, PROJECT SPACES should not be used to discuss political or religious beliefs, or other sensitive issues.

## 3 Moderation

### 3.1 Procedure

If you encounter a user transgressing against THE CODE, you should report it using the process described below. *Do not* post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against an individual or group.

* Contact the PROJECT MODERATORS, or if you feel uncomfortable doing this, one of the Moderator Contacts (see section 3.3).
* Wait up to 72 hours for a response (longer if you choose to contact an individual).

If the PROJECT MODERATORS decide that there is compelling evidence of a transgression, they will:

* Inform the ACCUSED PARTY of the contents of the report, and ask him/her for a statement.
* With the permission of the REPORTING PARTY, when deemed applicable, contact other members of THE PROJECT community for comment or further information.

After this, the PROJECT MODERATORS will decide how to act. Possible actions include:

* No action.
* Private mediation between the ACCUSED PARTY and other parties central to the report.
* A request for a private or public apology.
* A private warning.
* A temporary ban from one or more PROJECT SPACES.
* A permanent ban from one or more PROJECT SPACES.

The ACCUSED PARTY will be made aware of the decision, and will be granted the right to appeal the decision to the PROJECT MODERATORS.

### 3.2 Fair Moderation

The PROJECT MODERATORS agree to do the following:

* Recuse any of the PROJECT MODERATORS who are concerned with the report, from the discussions of the report.
* Not to notify any person outside of the PROJECT MODERATORS, the ACCUSED PARTY or the REPORTING PARTY of the details of the report, with the exceptions detailed under 3.1.
* Not to notify the ACCUSED PARTY of the identity of the REPORTING PARTY.
* Handle the report with discretion and sensitivity, to protect the privacy of involved parties.
